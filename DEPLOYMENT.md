## GitHub Repository Setup

### Repository Configuration

**Step 1: Create Repository**
If you haven't already, create a new repository on GitHub:
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it `google-flights-clone` or your preferred name
4. Set it to public or private based on your needs
5. Initialize with README if starting fresh

**Step 2: Push Your Code**
```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/google-flights-clone.git

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Google Flights clone implementation"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Step 3: Repository Settings**
Configure your repository for optimal deployment:
- Enable GitHub Pages if using GitHub Pages deployment
- Set up branch protection rules for main branch
- Configure repository secrets for sensitive information
- Add appropriate repository description and topics

### Branch Strategy

**Main Branch:** Keep the main branch stable and deployment-ready. All code in main should be tested and ready for production.

**Development Branch:** Use a development branch for ongoing work and feature development. Merge to main only when features are complete and tested.

**Feature Branches:** Create separate branches for individual features or bug fixes. Use descriptive branch names like `feature/airport-autocomplete` or `fix/theme-switching`.

## Vercel Deployment

Vercel provides the optimal deployment platform for React applications with automatic builds, global CDN, and seamless GitHub integration.

### Initial Deployment Setup

**Step 1: Vercel Account Setup**
1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up using your GitHub account for seamless integration
3. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub repositories

**Step 2: Import Project**
1. Click "New Project" in your Vercel dashboard
2. Select "Import Git Repository"
3. Choose your `google-flights-clone` repository
4. Click "Import"

**Step 3: Configure Project Settings**
Vercel automatically detects Vite projects, but verify these settings:

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
Development Command: npm run dev
```

**Step 4: Environment Variables**
Add the following environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

```
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_actual_rapidapi_key_here
VITE_RAPIDAPI_HOST=sky-scrapper.p.rapidapi.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Google Flights Clone
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

**Step 5: Deploy**
Click "Deploy" to start the build process. Vercel will:
- Clone your repository
- Install dependencies
- Build the application
- Deploy to global CDN
- Provide a live URL

### Automatic Deployments

**Production Deployments:** Configure automatic deployments from your main branch. Every push to main will trigger a new production deployment.

**Preview Deployments:** Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for pull requests, allowing you to test changes before merging.

**Branch Deployments:** Configure specific branches for staging or development deployments.

### Custom Domain Configuration

**Step 1: Domain Purchase**
Purchase a domain from your preferred registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.).

**Step 2: Add Domain to Vercel**
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

**Step 3: DNS Configuration**
Configure your domain's DNS settings:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61
```

**Step 4: SSL Certificate**
Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. Verify HTTPS is working after DNS propagation.

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

Configure the following variables for production deployment:

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=prod_api_key_here
VITE_RAPIDAPI_HOST=sky-scrapper.p.rapidapi.com

# Application Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Google Flights Clone
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_APP_ENV=production

# Performance Configuration
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=15000
VITE_CACHE_DURATION=300000

# Analytics (if implemented)
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
```

### Staging Environment

For staging deployments, use separate API keys and configuration:

```env
# Staging API Configuration
VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=staging_api_key_here
VITE_RAPIDAPI_HOST=sky-scrapper.p.rapidapi.com
VITE_APP_ENV=staging
```

### Security Considerations

**Environment Variable Security:**
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Use different API keys for different environments
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage for unusual patterns

**Access Control:**
- Limit repository access to necessary team members
- Use branch protection rules
- Require code reviews for main branch changes
- Enable two-factor authentication

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimization

**Bundle Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build
npx vite-bundle-analyzer dist
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Code splitting for route-based loading
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Image optimization and compression
- Asset minification and compression

### CDN Configuration

**Vercel CDN:** Vercel automatically configures global CDN distribution with edge caching for optimal performance worldwide.

**Cache Headers:** Configure appropriate cache headers for different asset types:
- Static assets: Long-term caching (1 year)
- HTML files: Short-term caching (1 hour)
- API responses: Appropriate caching based on data freshness

### Performance Monitoring

**Core Web Vitals:** Monitor key performance metrics:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Lighthouse Scores:** Regularly audit with Lighthouse to maintain high performance scores across all categories.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Deployment Monitoring

**Vercel Analytics:** Enable Vercel Analytics for detailed performance insights and user behavior tracking.

**Error Monitoring:** Implement error tracking to monitor application health:
- JavaScript error tracking
- API failure monitoring
- Performance regression detection

### Maintenance Schedule

**Regular Updates:**
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security audits
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Annual architecture reviews

**Backup Strategy:**
- Regular repository backups
- Environment configuration backups
- Deployment history maintenance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check that all required variables are set
- Ensure no trailing spaces in variable values

**API Connection Issues:**
- Verify API keys are correct and active
- Check API usage limits and quotas
- Test API endpoints independently

### Performance Issues

**Slow Loading:**
- Analyze bundle size and optimize large dependencies
- Implement code splitting for better loading performance
- Optimize images and assets

**API Timeouts:**
- Increase timeout values in environment configuration
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Add loading states for better user experience

### Rollback Procedures

**Quick Rollback:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to "Deployments" tab
3. Find previous stable deployment
4. Click "Promote to Production"

**Git Rollback:**
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Support Resources

**Vercel Support:** Access Vercel documentation and support for deployment-specific issues.

**GitHub Support:** Use GitHub's support resources for repository and version control issues.

**Community Resources:** Leverage React and Vite community resources for technical issues.
