React was chosen for its component-based architecture, excellent performance through virtual DOM, and extensive ecosystem of supporting libraries. The application leverages React's latest features including hooks for state management, context for theme management, and functional components throughout.

**Vite 4.4.5:** Vite serves as the build tool and development server, providing lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) during development and optimized production builds. Vite was selected over Create React App for its superior performance, smaller bundle sizes, and modern ES modules support. The Vite configuration includes optimizations for production deployment and proper handling of environment variables.

**Material UI 5.14.1:** Material UI provides the component library and design system foundation. This choice ensures consistency with Google's Material Design principles while providing a comprehensive set of pre-built, accessible components. Material UI's theming system enables the light/dark mode functionality and maintains design consistency across all components.

**TypeScript Support:** While the current implementation uses JavaScript for rapid development, the project structure supports easy migration to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience in production environments.

### API Integration Layer

**Sky-Scrapper API:** The application integrates with the Sky-Scrapper API from RapidAPI to provide real-time flight data. This API was selected for its comprehensive coverage of global flight information, reliable uptime, and well-documented endpoints. The integration includes proper error handling, rate limiting considerations, and fallback mechanisms.

**Axios 1.4.0:** HTTP client library for making API requests with built-in request/response interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, and comprehensive error handling. Axios provides a more robust solution compared to the native fetch API, especially for complex API interactions.

**React Query (TanStack Query):** State management library specifically designed for server state management. React Query handles caching, background updates, and synchronization of server data, reducing the complexity of API state management and improving application performance.

### Development Tools & Build System

**ESLint & Prettier:** Code quality and formatting tools ensure consistent code style across the project. The ESLint configuration includes React-specific rules and accessibility checks, while Prettier handles automatic code formatting.

**Vite Plugin Ecosystem:** The project utilizes several Vite plugins including @vitejs/plugin-react for React support, and various optimization plugins for production builds.

### Architecture Patterns

**Component-Based Architecture:** The application follows a hierarchical component structure with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility and communicates with other components through props and context.

**Container/Presentational Pattern:** Components are organized into containers (smart components that handle logic and state) and presentational components (pure components that focus on rendering UI).

**Custom Hooks Pattern:** Business logic is extracted into custom hooks, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns. Examples include useFlightSearch for search functionality and useTheme for theme management.

**Service Layer Pattern:** API interactions are abstracted into service modules, providing a clean interface between components and external data sources.

### State Management Strategy

**Local State with useState:** Component-specific state is managed using React's built-in useState hook for simple, localized state needs.

**Context API:** Global state such as theme preferences and user settings are managed through React Context, avoiding prop drilling while maintaining simplicity.

**Server State with React Query:** All server-side data (flight information, airport data) is managed through React Query, which provides caching, synchronization, and error handling out of the box.

**Form State Management:** Form state is handled through controlled components with custom validation logic, ensuring real-time feedback and proper error handling.

## Best Practices & Considerations

This section outlines the development best practices, coding standards, and architectural decisions that ensure the Google Flights clone maintains high quality, performance, and maintainability throughout its lifecycle.

### Code Quality Standards

**Component Design Principles:** Every component follows the single responsibility principle, ensuring each component has a clear, focused purpose. Components are designed to be reusable, testable, and maintainable with well-defined prop interfaces and clear documentation.

**State Management Best Practices:** State is managed at the appropriate level of the component hierarchy, with local state for component-specific data and global state for shared application data. The application avoids prop drilling through strategic use of React Context and custom hooks.

**Performance Optimization:** The application implements React best practices for performance including proper use of React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Code splitting and lazy loading are used to optimize bundle size and loading performance.

**Accessibility Standards:** All components follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and semantic HTML structure. Color contrast ratios meet accessibility requirements, and the application is fully navigable using keyboard-only input.

### API Integration Best Practices

**Error Handling Strategy:** Comprehensive error handling covers all possible failure scenarios with appropriate user feedback and recovery options. The application gracefully degrades functionality when API services are unavailable.

**Rate Limiting Compliance:** Client-side rate limiting ensures compliance with API usage limits while maintaining optimal user experience. Request queuing and intelligent retry mechanisms handle temporary failures without user intervention.

**Data Validation:** All API responses are validated against expected schemas to ensure data integrity and prevent application errors from malformed responses.

**Security Considerations:** API keys are properly secured through environment variables, and all requests use HTTPS with appropriate authentication headers.

### Development Workflow

**Version Control:** The project follows Git best practices with meaningful commit messages, feature branches, and proper merge strategies. Code reviews are conducted for all changes to maintain code quality.

**Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive testing includes unit tests for individual components, integration tests for API interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows.

**Documentation Standards:** All code includes appropriate comments and documentation, with README files for complex modules and inline documentation for complex functions.

**Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and deployment pipelines ensure code quality and enable rapid, reliable deployments.
